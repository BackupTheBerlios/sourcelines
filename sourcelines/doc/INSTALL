SourceLines: Open Source Software Announcement and Retrieval System
==================================================================

Base Requirements
-----------------

In order to setup SourceLines the following prerequisits are necessary:

- a Unix Box installed and connected to the Internet
- an Apache Web Server (http://www.apache.org)
- PHP (mod_php) Apache Module (http://www.php.net)
- MySQL Database Server (http://www.mysql.com)
- an email system
- a Mailing List System, e.g. Mailman (http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman.html)

The above doesn't mean that it wouldn't work with other configurations,
OS's, DB's etc, but we only provide INSTALL instructions for the above
configuration.
 
Set-up of the required packages is beyond the scope of this document
and if you are not sure how to install you should check each of
the appropriate web sites for further details.

Installing the Package
----------------------

Unzip and Untar the package into the directory you want to use on you web
server, if you are not sure where it is, ask you system administrator.

    tar -zxvf sourelines-x.x.x.tar.gz

Change to the sql/ directory. There exist a file called "sourcelines.sql"
which contains the commands to build the database structure, 
tables and default data.

1) Create a database called, for example, sourcelines:

    mysql -h host -u database_superuser -p
    (enter superuser_password)
    mysql> USE mysql;
    mysql> INSERT INTO user VALUES ( 'host', 'sourcelines', PASSWORD('sourcelines_password'), 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N');
    mysql> quit  
    mysqladmin create sourcelines

2) Now create the tables of the sourcelines database using commands in
sourcelines.sql file:

    mysql -h host -u sourcelines -p
    (enter sourcelines_password)
    mysql sourcelines < sourcelines.sql
    
3) That's it!... now you need to edit the file "config.php3" to set up the
options. Please read carefully the instructions in that file!
After that, point your browser to:

    http://yourdomain.com/admuser.php3

Login with the following data at the prompt:

    Username: admin
    Password: admin

For security reasons please change the admin password and username 
"immediately". You can do this by clicking on the "Change" button.


Testing the Installation
------------------------

Go to your homepage, for example:

    http://yourdomain.com/
    
    We recommend the use of phpMyAdmin. It's a good administration system for
MySQL databases. To download it just go to http://phpwizard.net/phpMyAdmin

    We also recommend to set a password for your MySQL access.
This is important as some data in the nuke database is not encrypted,
so for security reasons you need to set a password, not only that, it's
good practice!


Final Notes
-----------

    That's it! You're done with SourceLines.

    To change your site's logo, edit the config.php3 file.
