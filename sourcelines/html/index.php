<P><H2>SourceLines</H2>

<P><B>Latest Version: 0.1 (Development)
<BR>Latest Stable Version: 0.1</B>

<P>SourceLines is a highly configurable, well documented Open Source Solutions system entirely written in PHP and database independent. It includes user authentication and autherization system (anonymous/user/admin), sessions with and without cookies, high configurability, multilangual support, ease of administration, RDF-type document backend, announcing mailing lists, solution indexing by branches, categories and contacts, installation support and many other useful features.

<P>SourceLines depends on the PHPLib library (version 7.2 or later). Only if you want to have diary and weekly mailing lists with the announcements, you should also have Mailman installed in your box.

<P>You can see a fully working example of the SourceLines system at BerliOS
SourceLines by visiting <A HREF="http://sourcelines.berlios.de">http://sourcelines.berlios.de</A>. A close look at it will show you what
you can do with SourceLines.

<P>BerliOS SourceLines is part of the BerliOS project at GMD FOKUS. Please, have
a look at <A HREF="http://www.berlios.de">http://www.berlios.de</A> for further information.

<P>SourceLines can be easily translated into different
languages. If you see that SourceLines does not have support in your
language, you're gladly invited to <A HREF="translating.php3">help us with the
internationalization</A> of SourceLines by sending us your translation.
