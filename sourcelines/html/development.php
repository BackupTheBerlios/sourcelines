<P><H2>For developers</H2>

<P>SourceLines is Open Source, so you're invited to contribute to it.

<P>SourceLines has been thought as a documentation and retrieval system for Open Source Solutions, but maybe you're interested in adapting SourceLines to document other kind of things. Or maybe you want to improve
SourceLines adding features or correcting errors. If one of these is your case, keeping on reading will be of interest for you.

<P>The documentation that is included in the <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/project/filelist.php?group_id=91">SourceLines package</A> has been made with the idea of a developer who wants to
make further development in SourceLines or who wants to make some
modifications so that SourceLines suits his needs.

<P>Note: For developing or modifying SourceLines, <A HREF="http://www.php.net">PHP</A> knowledge is needed. You should also have
certain SQL experience if you want to handle with databases.

<P>Please report to the <A HREF="authors.php3">authors</A> any adaptions and/or modifications. This
could help us knowing what SourceLines should implement in the future
and making other SourceLines users benefit from your work.

<P>For advanced uses, <A HREF="http://phplib.netuse.de/">PHPLib</A> should also be known. You can read about
PHPLib's API in PHPLib's manual. At this moment, PHPLib is used only
for sessions and authentication. If you aren't going to work with
them, you don't need to have a look at PHPLib.

<P>&nbsp;
